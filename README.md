# TNC_Analysis

This notebook is for the data analysis of TNC Agricultural Survey of African Farm householdâ€™s dataset.

# Overview and Introduction
This is work done by Livingstone Mumelo as  test for the innovation specialist position. The code has been developed locally with data downloaded from Kaggle and analysis doen using python on Jupyter notebook editor. All necessary packages have to be installed before running code. The code does basic analysis to showcase my expertise, given enough time, we can dive deeper into more serious analysis and modelling.

# Create a Working Directory on local machine

Use the shared Link ```https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/agricultural-survey-of-african-farm-households/data?select=data.csv ``` to download the dataset to your local computer. Once downloaded, unzib the file and select the data.csv file then dump on the local folder

1. Drop your dataset into that working directory

2. Open command prompt on that working directory and Run the line below to pull the code on local working directory:

```git clone https://github.com/livingstone90/TNC_Analysis.git```

3. Download Anaconda software from here  ```https://www.anaconda.com/download```

4. Confirm if your python work environment is working well.

5. Open Jupyter notebook from Anaconda

6. Move to the working directory and open the notebook called ```TNC Analysis```

7. Install necessary packages using ```pip install (package name)```

8. Once packages are installed, start running the script per cell
